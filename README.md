# OneSky Helper
[![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/ZeeCoder/onesky-helper.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/ZeeCoder/onesky-helper)

This is a simple Helper class, which uses the OneSky SDK internally.

It is created to collect useful calls to the API, while staying agnosting
about the framework it resides in.

The main focus is that it can be used in Symfony Console Commands, which
then can be used in Symfony or Silex projects.
