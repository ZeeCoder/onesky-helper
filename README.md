# OneSky Helper

This is a simple Helper class, which uses the OneSky SDK internally.

It is created to collect useful calls to the API, while staying agnostic
about the framework it resides in.

The main focus is that it can be used in Symfony Console Commands, which
then can be used in Composer, Symfony or Silex projects.


## Install

composer require zeecoder/onesky-helper
